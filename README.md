## Description

Define snippets of text that can be easily pasted into text fields


## Requirements

The plugin requires [Mantis](http://www.mantisbt.org/) version 1.2.0 or higher
and jQuery version 1.6 or later.

Install the [jQuery plugin](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/jquery)
before proceeding with the steps below.


## Installation

1. Download or clone a copy of the [plugin's code](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/snippets).
2. Copy the plugin (the `Snippets/` directory) into your Mantis
   installation's `plugins/` directory.
3. While logged into your Mantis installation as an administrator, go to
   *Manage -> Manage Plugins*.
4. In the *Available Plugins* list, you'll find the *Snippets* plugin;
   click the **Install** link.
5. In the *Installed Plugins* list, click on the **Snippets** plugin to configure it.


## Usage

### Managing Snippets

- Global snippets can be managed from *Manage -> Manage Plugins*.
- User-specific snippets can be managed from *My Account -> My Snippets*.

The following placeholders are supported in the Snippet's text; they will be
replaced by the corresponding contents when inserted:

 Placeholder | Description
:-----------:|-------------------------
%u           | your username
%r           | the bug reporter's name
%h           | the bug handler's name
%p           | the project name


### Using Snippets

Each configured text field will have a selection list above it, which can be
used to pick the desired Snippet.

Once selection is made, the Snippet's text will be inserted in the field at the
current position. If text is currently selected, the Snippet will replace the
selection.

By default only the *Bug Note* field is configured to use Snippets.
Other text fields (*Description*, *Steps To Reproduce* as well as *Additional
Information*) can be setup to use Snippets via configuration option `plugin_Snippets_textarea_names`
where you can list names of fields you are interested in, i.e. `bugnote_text, steps_to_reproduce, body` (`body`
refers to text area on *Send reminder* page).
